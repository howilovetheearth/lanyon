title: Loving Resistance
---

The January 6th coup illuminated the consequences of a media culture that normalizes fascism undergirded by racism.
 Silence and violence are complicities.
  We need robust, loving activism.
   Please join us in building shrines and artwork in city centers, town squares, and parks that:

* Show support for democracy, and envision the world we want.
* Demonstrate multi-racial solidarity, allyship, climate justice, an equitable future, respect, and love for one another and all species.
* Display beautiful drawings, paintings, photos, images, candles, flowers, and notes. Offer materials so passers-by can create and participate. (To lessen security concerns, perhaps avoid sculpture, containers, hardware, and bottles.)
