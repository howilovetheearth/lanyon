title: Loving Resistance
---

The January 6th coup showed the consequences of media culture that normalizes fascism
undergirded by racism. Staying silent is not a viable option. Neither is violent engagement.
What we need is loving resistance. To that end, join us in building shrines and artwork at
City Centers, Town Squares, Parks that:

* Show support for Democracy and envision the world that we want to live in.
* Demonstrate multi-racial solidarity and allyship, climate justice, an equitable future, respect and love for one another and all species.
* Beautiful drawings, paintings, photos, images, candles, flowers, notes, materials for passer-bys to create and participate. (Avoid 3D sculpture, containers, hardware, or bottles of any kind to alleviate security concerns.)
