Building a shrine is really simple! Just follow these steps:

1. Identify a public location (we suggest avoiding government offices,
to foreclose any security concerns that our shrines are dangerous).
2. Print out however many messages you want from

 flowers and candles.
4. Take pictures of your mural (please
